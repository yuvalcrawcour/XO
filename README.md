# XO
XO game
all the relevant code is in main.py.
this project shows my ability to self learn new APIs such as pygame, 
and the ability to take control over the logic behind the program,
which in this case includes data structures, loops and complicated if statments.
basicaly the XO game is happening on a 3x3 grid (implemented by a 2d list), and when the user clickes on a certain key the program reacts by drawing an X or an O.
the project containts comments, i hope it helps to understand what the code means.
if you have any questions you can contact me at yuvalcrawcour@gmail.com
